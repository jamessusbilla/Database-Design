Aged Care Activity Management System

<em>Problem Statement</em> 
A client in aged care business is concerned about the growing suicide rate among adults aged 65+. To reduce this suicide rate, the client had an idea which was about patients having a companion to reduce the sense of isolation developing among patients. Example of companions can be anyone in the age group of 17 years to 45 years old. There is a desire for an activity management system which will allow both companion as well as the patient to have interaction together through the assigned activity by the client  or the patient will suggest what activities one wants. Activities can be anything from talking, running, shopping, strolling, or playing. The activity management system would act as a prevention system of patient from feeling sense of isolation, such system could provide patient a companion which they can talk to and even share their feeling. This system would need to store information about the companion, the patient as well as the activities they both did together. The system must also store the patients’ health records – any check-ups from their GP’s, their Carers, GP’s, as well as logs any family visits of their relatives
